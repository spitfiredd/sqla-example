# sqlalchemy-examples

Testing ground for various ideas or use cases for sqlalchemy.

## Getting Started

You will need to have python and pipenv installed on your machine. To get your envrionment setup with the package dependencies run `pipenv install --ignore-pipfile` this will used the `Pipfile.lock` to create the same environment as the last time you ran `pipenv lock`.

After you environment is setup run `pipenv shell` to activate your environment.

You can now run an example, for example,

```
python -m examples.app
```

More examples coming soon!!

## Contributing

Use git flow principals, fork develop branch to your repo and create a new feature or bug fix branch. Once done submit a pull request to merge your changes to the develop branch.

Will probably use versioneer at some later date.
